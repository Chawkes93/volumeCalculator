1) Using the dropdown list of accounts, select an account to sync data from		
2) Click the "Sync" button	
3) Adjust "Percent to Utilize" to however much of the Contract Total you want to allocate to recurring scans	
4) Check "Only for Days Remaining" if you'd like the calculation to only consider Audit settings for days remaining in the contract year - leave it unchecked for a full 365 day calculation	
5) Use the drop down list in G11 to determine how you'd like to calculate "Available Volume", by subtracting one of the metrics inlcuded in the dropdown list (e.g. I want to take into account what page volume is forecasted to be by end of contract year)	
6) Select which groups of Audits you'd like to include in your implementation, based on frequency, in column E (e.g. I want Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Audits)	
7) Determine how many Audits per "Frequency Group" that you'd like to include in your implementation, in column F (e.g. how many Daily Audits do I want to create)	
8) Determine what percentage of your "Available Volume" that you'd like to allocate to each group of Audits, in column G - they should add up to 100% (e.g. I want to allocate 50% of my available volume to my Weekly Audits)	
9) Refer to column L for your Audit page limits, and apply them each individual Audit and their respective frequency within OP
